# NH's 48

A place for peakbaggers to share pictures from their hikes of the 4,000-footers in New Hampshire, known affectionately as the "NH 48."

## Welcome

Users can create profiles with pictures of themselves and a short biography. They may eventually be able to follow other users, and interact through posts. A timestamp keeps track of how long they have been a member of the website.

When posting a photo, a drop-down menu listing all 48 of the 4,000-footers appears. This is meant to discourage the posting of pics from places other than these 48 mountains; it may also assist with future efforts to organize the posts by mountain.

Posters have the ability to delete their posts, but not posts made by others.
